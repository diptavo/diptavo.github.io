I have been involved in large number of collaborations spanning from large-scale genetic studies to methodological work. I actively collaborate with investigators of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, faculty, postdocs and students in Department of Epidemiology and School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Department of Biostatistics, Rutgers University. Further, I work with several research groups at the National Cancer Institute. See more in <a href="https://diptavo.github.io/pages/pubs.html"><b>Publications</b></a>.
